TATA Motors Price Prediction Using LSTM Model

In this project, I utilized historical data from TATA Motors to predict future stock prices. The core of the analysis involved the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. By leveraging the sequential nature of stock price data, the LSTM model was able to capture complex patterns and trends, providing accurate predictions for future prices
